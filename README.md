# ANova Finance Reimbursement Script ðŸ’°ðŸ’µ
This tool automates submitting purchase requests on Callink using [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev). Using the Reimbursement Submission Form response spreadsheet, it retrieves ALL Stage 0 purchase requests and puts them all in Stage 1 on Callink.

**You must be a Stage 2 Financial Requester/Agent for the club in order to use this script.**

## Prerequisites ðŸ’»

### Install Dependencies
1. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all necessary dependencies.


### Enable the Google Sheets API
1. Go to [Google Sheets API Python Quickstart](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/quickstart/python?authuser=1#step_1_turn_on_the) and complete Step 1.
2. If asked to configure your OAuth client, select `Desktop App`.
3. Click `DOWNLOAD CLIENT CONFIGURATION` and put the downloaded `credentials.json` into `/anova_finance`.

### Retrieve your Google Profile
Since Selenium always opens up a new instance of the browser, you want to save your Berkeley login into a cookie so you don't have to sign in each time you run the script.

1. Open Google Chrome and log in to your Berkeley email.
2. In a new tab, go to `chrome://version` and copy your Profile Path. On Mac, it should look something like: ```/Users/name/.../Google/Chrome/Default```
3. In `submission.py`, paste your profile path as a string to `PROFILE_PATH`.

## Link the Reimbursement Spreadsheet
We'll create a separate file to store the `SPREADSHEET_ID` of the Reimbursement Submission spreadsheet so that it is not in plain text on GitHub. **This file should never be pushed or committed.**

1. Create a file called `secrets.py`.
2. On the Reimbursement Submission spreadsheet, copy the spreadsheet id by going to its link. The spreadsheet ID looks like a hash in the link: ```https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/{spreadsheet_id}/edit```
3. In `secrets.py`, set `SPREADSHEET_ID = 'spreadsheet_id'`. Make sure `SPREADSHEET_ID` is a string.
4. Exit Google Chrome.

## Running the Reimbursement Script ðŸ”¥
Currently, the script submits all purchase requests that have not been submitted yet (in Stage 0). This is based on the Reimbursement Submission Google Form responses. All purchase requests are in Stage 0 until it is submitted on Callink.

### Submitting all Stage 0 Reimbursements:
1. **MAKE SURE YOU ClOSE ANY OPEN CHROME WINDOWS OR THE SCRIPT WILL NOT WORK!**
2. On the command line, make sure you are in the root directory of this project: `/anova_finance`.
3. Run `python submission.py`

Google Chrome should automatically open and visit ANova's finance page on Callink. **Do not click anything** â€” the script will automatically fill in the values of the required fields on the Purchase Request Form based on the responses of the Reimbursement Submission Form response spreadsheet and submit them one-by-one.

And that's it! Happy financing.
